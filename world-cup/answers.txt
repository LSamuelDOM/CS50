Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

I was thinking about, with more simulations, all teams with high numbers will get better percentage number, but, when I run any simulation with N = 10, almost all winners teams has the same chance, and with more simulations the difference will grow a lot.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

I think with 10000 simulations, because with this number get almost the same values than 100000 and 1000000, but a faster output answer, as i said, for me it was the best values to have most right result possible.
